# Hand on kuberentes

## Odoo application

Kubernetes is an open source developed by Google for managing containerized applications. For deploying Odoo in Kubernetes, in local, we have to configure minikube and kubectl in our local.

To deploy Odoo in Kubernetes, we must deploy Odoo and Postgres in our cluster. Officially there is an Odoo image and a Postgres image in the docker hub. We have to set up a docker for Postgres and Odoo.

```
minikube start


cd oddoapp

kubectl apply -f .

```

```
kubectl get storageclass

note the name of your storageclass and add that to your application
```
